# Backup_system
Welcome to my project. This is the graduate work for my bachelor degree.
The installation process is very simple:
- You need the Vagrant & Virtualbox.
- Go to the folders & type: `vagrant up`. This will download the boxes
- Then, launch the debugging application by command `gulp` within that directory

Navigate to Master folder to see it in action. Type in the `192.168.50.4` or `localhost:3000` if you have launched vagrant. You will be redirected to the slave server. To watch the status - write `192.168.50.4/index` or `localhost:3000/index`.
It best works with sourcemaps enabled in your preferred browser.

That's it. Thanks for attention ^.^
