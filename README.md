# Backup_system
Welcome to my project. This is the graduate work for my bachelor degree.
The installation process is very simple:
- You need the Vagrant & Virtualbox.
- Go to the folders & type: `vagrant up`. This will download the boxes
- Then, launch the debugging application by command `gulp` within that directory

That's it. Thanks for attention ^.^
